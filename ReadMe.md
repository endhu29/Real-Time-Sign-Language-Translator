# 🌐 Real-Time Sign Language Translator

A web-based application that translates sign language gestures into text or speech in real time using AI and machine learning. This project helps bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers.

# 📌 Description

The Real-Time Sign Language Translator uses a webcam to capture hand gestures and applies machine learning models to recognize sign language. The detected gestures are translated instantly into readable text or voice output through a web interface. The system runs in a browser and does not require special hardware.
